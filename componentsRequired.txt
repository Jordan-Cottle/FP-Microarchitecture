--Components Required--
** Completed
-Minor components-
Adder1 - For incrementing PC by 1
AdderX - for incrementing PC by X
**Mux2To1_1b - Standard Mux for choosing binary signals
**Mux2To1_32b - Mux for choosing between 32bit signals
**Decoder10To1024 - For addressing data/instruction memory
Decoder4To16 - addressing reigsters

-Major Comopnents-
FileReader/Simulation - parses our program and loads instructions into instruction memory  (clock to synchronize components?)
PC - for controlling flow of processor -- clocked component
Controller - for issuing control signals neccessary for proper functinoality
Instruction Memory - 1024 addresses of 32 bits each, PC in, 2x32 bit out
Data Memory - 1024 addresses of 32 bits each, calculated address in, control in, data in, result out
ALU - performs math calculations, 2x32b in, control in, result out, negative out, zero out
